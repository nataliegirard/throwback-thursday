<center><h2>IN CASE YOU THOUGHT THAT WE KNEW EVERYTHING AND THE REST WAS JUST DETAILS</h2></center><br>

1. In the beginning there was nothing, then something went wrong.[Murphy's Law]<br>
2. The empty set contains and is contained within all other sets.[Fibonacci's Rule]<br>
3. Universe has no plural.<br>
4. Space is nothing.<br>
5. Time is an abstraction.<br>
6. Energy is the opposite of mass.<br>
7. Energy is not effected by gravity.<br>
8. In order for two points to exist, a third point must exist between them.<br>
9. Less than enough is not sufficient, more than enough is not necessary.<br>
10. Enough is a finite quantity.<br>
11. That which has been done is not impossible.<br>
12. Pythagoras trisected an angle.<br>
13. Mathematics is a set of languages providing different ways to describe reality.<br>
14. Statistical norms are not real integers even when they are whole numbers.<br>
15. A line representing a continuous function contains no discrete elements.<br>
16. A "Field" is a continuous static structure extending to infinity.<br>
17. "Field Lines" are mathematical constructs having no existence.<br>
18. Reality is what it is irrespective of description.<br>
19. Ptolomy was believed because his math was correct and it worked.<br>
20. The "Plane of the Elliptic" is perpendicular to and centered upon the Barycenter of the
	Solar System (or any other system).<br>
21. All orbits are planes of ecliptic.<br>
22. The eccentricity of an orbit is proportional to the deviation from the perpendicular to
	the path of the center of mass. [Kepler's 4th Law]<br>
23. The Earth does not revolve around the Sun, the Sun and the Earth revolve around the center
	of mass.<br>
24. There is no error in the orbit of Mercury.<br>
25. A measured value is the sum of its contributing elements.<br>
26. The specific computed values of the elements do not change the measured sum.<br>
27. The measured gravity of the Sun was the same after Einstein as before.<br>
28. The bending of light observed near a star is thermal reflection, a mirage.<br>
29. Velocity is measured at two different times, not on two different objects.<br>
30. A zero based measurement is required to know the value of measured variables.<br>
31. The "Aberration of Light" is the same in a column of water as it is in a column of air.<br>
32. The velocity of light is constant in all media.<br>
33. The aberration of light is a measure of the Earth's absolute velocity.<br>
34. Light is a spherical wave containing no particles.<br>
35. The outside of a wave has more degrees of freedom than the middle, the inside has fewer.<br>
36. As a wave expands outward from it's source, it expands outward from it's middle, a red shift.<br>
37. The further away it is, the greater the red shift, coming or going.<br>
38. The energy required to operate a mechanism increases with velocity while the available
	energy decreases.<br>
39. There is nothing new here, it's all old stuff. You must get the old stuff right before you
	can benefit from the new.
