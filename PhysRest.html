			<br><h1>Furgeson and the Unified Field Theory</h1><br>

			<p>In the beginning there was Aristotle<br>
			And objects at rest tended to remain at rest<br>
			And objects in motion tended to come to rest<br>
			And God saw that it was boring, although very restful.</p>

			<p>Then God created Newton<br>
			And objects at rest tended to remain at rest<br>
			And objects in motion tended to remain in motion<br>
			And energy was conserved, and momentum was conserved,<br>
			And matter was conserved<br>
			And God saw that it was conservative.<br>

			</p>Then God created Einstein<br>
			And everything was relative<br>
			And fast things became short<br>
			And straight things became curved<br>
			And the universe was filled with inertial frames<br>
			And God saw that it was relatively general<br>
			but some of it was especially relative.</p>

			<p>Then God created Bohr<br>
			And there was the principle<br>
			And the principle was quantum<br>
			And all things were quantified<br>
			But some things were still relative<br>
			And God saw that it was confusing.</p>

			<p>Then God was going to create Furgeson<br>
			And Furgeson would have unified<br>
			And he would have fielded a theory<br>
			And all would have been one.<br>
			But it was the seventh day<br>
			And God rested<br>
			And objects at rest tend to remain at rest.</p>
