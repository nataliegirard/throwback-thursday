				<p>Q: What is the definition of a tachyon?<br>
				A: It's a gluon that's not completely dry.</p>

				<p>Matter is fundamentally lazy:- It always takes the path of least effort<br>
				Matter is fundamentally stupid:- It tries every other path first.<br>
				That is the heart of physics - The rest is details.</p>

				<p>One of the buildings in the university I attend has a large Focault's
				pendulum in the lobby. Someone has attached a sign to its cable that says,
				"Warning - Stay away from cable. 18,000 ohms."</p>

				<p>A math&physics student was hit by a brick falling from a house. He
				fainted, but came to after a while and started smiling. The onlookers
				were worried, so they asked him why the smile. "I just realized how lucky
				I am because the kinetic energy is only half m v squared."</p>

				<p>K.K. Darrow in a colloqium that recounted some of his rememberances told
				this story about a European physicist. About 75 years ago the physicist was
				visiting the Harvard Library and couldn't find the Natural Philosophy
				section. He asked the librarian for help. She showed him to the proper
				section and said "We call it Physics."</p>

				<p>A physics book seems to be a mathematican's worst nightmare.</p>

				<p>Q:  What's the difference between a mass spectrometer and an electric guitar?<br>
				A:  You can tune a mass spectrometer.</p>

				<p>Q: What caused the big bang?<br>
				A: God divided by zero. Oops!</p>

				<p>Q: what happens when a yellow ball drops in a bucket filled with half water?<br>
				A: The ball becomes wet.</p>

				<p>Q: Why did the tachyon cross the road?<br>
				A: Because it was on the other side.</p>

				<p>Q. Why did the quantum chicken cross the road?<br>
				A. It was already on both sides of the road!</p>

				<p>Law of Selective Gravity:<br>
        			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				An object will fall so as to do the most damage.</p>

				<p>Jenning's Corollary:<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
       				The chance of the bread falling with the buttered side down is directly proportional
				to the cost of the carpet.</p>
