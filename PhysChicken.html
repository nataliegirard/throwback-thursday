			<br><h1>Why did the chicken cross the road?</h1><br>
			<u>Archimedes:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  A1: To actualize its potential.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				A2: She was buoyant and excited at the thought of new adventures.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				A3: Eureka!

			<p><u>ARISTOTLE:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  A1: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				A2: The other side of the road was its natural place.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				A3: To actualize its potential.</p>

			<p><u>Andre Ampere:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp To keep up with current events.</p>

			<p><u>Alexander Graham Bell:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  To get to the nearest phone.</p>

			<p><u>Robert Boyle:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  She had been under too much pressure at home.</p>

			<p><u>William J. Broad:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  "The crux is that the vast majority of the poultry in the
				universe seems to be missing."</p>

			<p><u>Marie Curie:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  She was radiating with enthusiasm as she crossed the road.</p>

			<p><u>Nicolaus Copernicus:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  Despite the evidence of you senses I can show that it
				is mathematically simpler to describe it as the road passing under the chicken.</p>

			<p><u>C. J. Doppler:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  For its effect on passer-bys.</p>

			<p><u>Thomas Edison:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  She thought it would be an illuminating experience.</p>

			<p><u>Richard Feynman:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  It didn't cross the road to the other side. It actually
				came back to where it started but was momentarily moving backward in time.

			<p><u>Jean Foucault:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  It didn’t. The rotation of the earth made it appear to cross.</p>

			<p><u>Buckminister Fuller:</u> Because we have not yet designed and implemented true,
				constantly forwardly/backwardly evolving, energy-transforming living
				machines which will enable us to perform all functions from the informedly
				turbining hub of a single autonomous in-spiralling/out-radiating network of
				space-connected information vector transforms. Had the chicken been
				supplied with my Dymaxion Tensegrity Coop, it would have remained at home,
				un-tempted by such risky spatial-temporal translations.</p>

			<p><u>Galileo:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  To get a better look at the stars.</p>

			<p><u>Karl Gauss:</u>  Because of the magnetic personality of the rooster on the other side.</p>

			<p><u>Hawking:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp	A1: The first seconds made the universe in such a way that
				chickens cross the road.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
					A2: There exist numerous parallel universes in which the same chicken is in
				differing stages of crossing the road.  Only when one of the chickens has
				completed crossing the road do their ave functions coallesce.</p>

			<p><u>Werner Heisenberg:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp	A1: We are not sure which side of the road the chicken was
				on, but it was moving very fast.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
					A2: It was uncertain if it could make it, but wanted to try on general principles.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
					A3: Because the chicken is moving very fast, you can either observe the
				chicken or you can measure the chicken, but you cannot do both.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
					A4: We could tell you how it crossed the road, but we couldn't tell you where.</p>

			<p><u>Gustav Hertz:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  Lately, its been crossing with greater frequency.</p>

			<p><u>Johannes Kepler:</u>  &nbsp&nbsp  He crossed in an arc, not a straight line.</p>

			<p><u>Lemaître:</u> &nbsp&nbsp  He crossed with a big bang.</p>

			<p><u>Newton:</u><br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				1) Chickens at rest tend to stay at rest.  Chickens in motion tend to
				   cross the road.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				2) It was pushed on the road.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				3) It was pushed on the road by another chicken, which went away from the road.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				4) It was attracted to a chicken on the other side of the road.<br>

			<blockquote>I have not yet found the cause of this behaviour of the chicken, based on
			the phenomenons and I do not make hypotheses.</blockquote><br>

			<blockquote>No doubt the ancients knew why the chicken crossed the road and I am
			studying the bible and try to rediscover their mathematics to find out why
			the chicken crossed the road.</blockquote><br>

			<blockquote>I wrote a manuscript on chickens crossing the road a few years back.  It is
			in a drawer somewhere and I will send it to you as soon as I find it, dear Halley.</blockquote><br>

			<blockquote>Because an apple fell on its head.</blockquote></p>


			<p><u>Ohm:</u> &nbsp&nbsp	A1: There was more resistance on this side of the road.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				A2: She resisted the idea at first.</p>

			<p><u>Pascal:</u> &nbsp&nbsp  It was pressured to cross the road.</p>
